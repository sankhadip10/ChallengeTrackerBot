### General

1. **Help Command**
!help

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sankhadip10/ChallengeTrackerBot.git
   cd ChallengeTrackerBot
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. **Run the bot**:
python bot_core.py

**Why is BotCommander Needed**?
The BotCommander role (or a similar role specified in your config.py) is essential for several reasons:

**Access Control**: Not all commands should be accessible to every user. Some commands, especially administrative ones, should only be available to trusted users or moderators. By designating a BotCommander role, you can ensure that only users with this role can execute certain privileged commands.

**Prevent Abuse**: Without role-based access control, any user could potentially misuse the bot, leading to spam, incorrect data, or even potential security risks. By restricting certain commands to the BotCommander role, you can mitigate these risks.

**Ease of Management**: Having a designated role for bot command execution makes it easier to manage who has access to what commands. If a new moderator joins the server, you can simply assign them the BotCommander role, and they'll have the necessary permissions.

Flexibility: By configuring the role in the config.py file, you can easily change the role name or add multiple roles with command execution privileges, giving you flexibility in how you manage your bot's permissions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration & Setup

### Configuring the Bot

1. **Bot Token**: 
   - Navigate to the `config.py` file in the root directory.
   - Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Discord bot token.
     ```python
     BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACTUAL_BOT_TOKEN"
     ```

2. **Sauce Labs Credentials**:
   - If you're using Sauce Labs for any functionality, you'll need to set up your credentials.
   - Navigate to [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) and obtain your username and access key.
   - In the `config.py` file, replace `XXXXX` with your Sauce Labs username and `YYYYYY` with your access key.
     ```python
     sauce_options_un = "YOUR_SAUCE_LABS_USERNAME"
     sauce_options_access_key = "YOUR_SAUCE_LABS_ACCESS_KEY"
     ```

### Data Validation

The bot currently uses web scraping techniques to validate data from LinkedIn posts. While this method is effective, it's worth noting that web scraping can be fragile due to potential changes in the website's structure. 

In the future, switching to official APIs for data validation. However, the current scraping method was chosen due to cost constraints, as many official APIs are not free.

### Test Cases

The bot is rigorously tested with more than 50 test cases to ensure its reliability and efficiency. This extensive testing ensures that the bot functions as expected and can handle various scenarios and edge cases.

## üöÄ Roadmap

The potential for this bot is vast, and there are several enhancements planned for the future:

- **API Integration**: The bot can be further enhanced through API contributions, allowing for more seamless data retrieval and processing.
- Instead of web scraping, consider integrating with official APIs (like LinkedIn's API) for more robust and reliable data validation. This would reduce the bot's dependency on the structure of web pages, which can change over time.

- **Email Notifications**: 
- Send emails to participants who are selected for rewards.
- Notify participants who didn't make the cut.
- Daily reminders for users who haven't updated their progress.

- **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback to continually improve the bot's features and user experience.

- **Integration with Other Platforms**: Expand the bot's capabilities to track progress on other platforms beyond LinkedIn.

- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement advanced analytics to provide insights into user participation, engagement levels, and more.
